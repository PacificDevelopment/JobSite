### 🛠️  Installation

Install the necessary dependencies with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
```bash
npm install
```

### 🔌  Usage

##### `npm` Scripts

- [x] Compile the *bundle.js* file with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) in production mode:

> ``` npm run build ```

- [x] Run the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server in production mode:

> ``` npm start ```

 #### Various scripts available and what they do:

> 1. Run the `webpack-dev-server` with [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/), run:

> ```npm run serve-react-dev```
> Then, visit [http://localhost:9000]. The page will automatically reload as file changes are made and saved.

 2. Run webpack watch/build *without* Hot Module Replacement

> ```npm run react-dev```


 3. Run the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) watching for changes at port 3000

> ```npm run server-dev```
> Then, visit [http://localhost:3000]. The page will need to be reloaded as changes are made, but the Express server will not need to be restarted.


4. Run the server with node debugger attached and watching for changes at port 3000

> `npm run debug`

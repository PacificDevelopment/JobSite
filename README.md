### üõ†Ô∏è  Installation

Install the necessary dependencies with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) <br/>

``` npm install ```

---

### üîå  Usage

##### ``` npm ``` Scripts

- [x] Compile the *bundle.js* file with [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) in production mode:

> ``` npm run build ```

- [x] Run the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server in production mode:

> ``` npm start ```

 #### Various scripts available and what they do:

1. Run the `webpack-dev-server` with [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/), run:

> ```npm run serve-react-dev``` <br/>
Then, visit [http://localhost:9000]. The page will automatically reload as file changes are made and saved.

 2. Run webpack watch/build *without* Hot Module Replacement

> ```npm run react-dev```


 3. Run the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) watching for changes at port 3000

> ```npm run server-dev``` <br/>
Then, visit [http://localhost:3000]. The page will need to be reloaded as changes are made, but the Express server will not need to be restarted.


4. Run the server with node debugger attached and watching for changes at port 3000

> ```npm run debug```

<hr/>
#### PostgreSQL Database Configuration:

1. Create a database in PostgreSQL

2. Run the *init.sql* file from the terminal 

3. Update the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your credentials.

``` bash
[sudo] psql -U [username] -f ./init.sql
```

---

#### Firebase Configuration:

1. Create an account with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a `firebaseConfig.js` file and include in the *FileUpload* folder. Make sure the name matches that included in the `.gitignore`
3. Enter your credentials provided by firebase in to the *config* file
4. Export the config object so it can be used in the `FileUpload.jsx` and `UploadAvatar.jsx` files

---

#### CareerJetAPI Configuration:

1. Create a partners account [here](https://www.careerjet.com/partners/signup.html) and enter your new AFFID in the `.env` file
